----- TODO -----

Redux:
State architecture:
Figure out a good architecture for states. What values should go where,
what states do we need, what info should be stored?



React:
UI:
UI needs an overhaul from somebody who knows what the f*ck they're doing.
Colors, fonts, styling and icons needs improvement.

Frontend:
Datahandler is needed. Redux is a sort of datahandler, but we need one for
more specific data (later to be fetched from database). Store in JSON-objects.

Backend:
Server-side application needed. Not important at the moment, but a general idea
of how can be beneficial. Grab and send data to the frontend application.
What data do we need? How should the data be sent?



General:
Licenses:
Need to add licenses for the libraries we use. Make a list of libraries and their
licenses, and make a file for dependencies.
React, React-router, React-redux, React-router-redux, Redux, Redux-logger,
Redux-thunk, Styles-loader, CSS-loader, Webpack, Express, Babel, History

Errorhandling:
Start implementing errorhandling from the beginning. Will be useful further on.

Testing:
Create test-files in same location as files to be tested.
Look at testing utilities and libraries. Jest?
